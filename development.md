# DEVELOPMENT NOTES

This is some notes as a reminder for how things work currently.

### Npc names

Each npc should have a unique name so the state manager can identify them. Numbers can be
given to npcs by using an underscore, this allows animation functions to correctly parse
the names and return the correct animations.
