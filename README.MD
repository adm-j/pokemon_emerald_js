# POKEMON EMERALD JS

This is a recreation of pokemon Emerald and its various mechanics using Phaser 3, Vite and nodejs.
The purpose of this is to learn more about games programming.

## Project setup

This project uses <b>Node 21.6.2</b>

Running this project locally will be as simple as installing dependencies ```npm i``` and using vite to run a dev server ```npm run dev```

An additional script is included to "extrude" tiles within tile ```npm run extrude-tiles```, this is to pad tilesets
to prevent rendering issues when used for tilemaps due to the camera zoom.

Tilemaps are being created with tiled, sprite sheets and sprites are from various sources. Full credit will be given in due course. (todo: add sources)
